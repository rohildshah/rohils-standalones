# standalones
A collection of my standalone projects. Please refer to my other repositories to view my more complicated projects.

## File Information:
### encoder-decoder:
File Type: Python (.py)

Ideal Platform: IDLE

Receives a string of letters with an asterix at the end. Returns a string which is a simple encryption of the received string. Also works the other way around.

--

### graphing-calculator:
File Type: Python (.py)

Ideal Platform: IDLE

Graphs simple `y=mx+b` functions. You are required to input the scale of the graph (step), the slope `m` in the form `a/b`, the y-intercept `b` in the form of a positive or negative number. Uses the `turtle` libraries.

--

### password-simple:
File Type: Python (.py)

Ideal Platform: IDLE

Simple demonstration of how a password system would work with python.

--

### star-drawing:
File Type: Python (.py)

Ideal Platform: IDLE

Very cool drawing of a star. Also can be modified to generate a curve mathematically.  Uses the `turtle` libraries.

--

### drawing-simulator:
File Type: Python (.py)

Ideal Platform: IDLE

Simple and inflexible drawing simulator that takes one letter inputs to control a pen on your screen. This is more of a proof of concept rather than an actual project.  Uses the `turtle` libraries.

--

### guess-the-number:
File Type: Python (.py)

Ideal Platform: IDLE

Game where you input numbers from 0-100 to try and guess a number predetermined by the program. Fun game to play with small children.

--

### hangman:
File Type: Python (.py)

Ideal Platform: IDLE

Crude version of hangman in which there are only three possible words the program can choose from. To people who haven't played the game multiple times, this program is pretty entertaining. Uses the `turtle` libraries.

--

### mad-libs:
File Type: Python (.py)

Ideal Platform: IDLE

Fun game to play with small children. You input a series of words that match the word type given, and watch as the program generates a funny and nonsensical predetermined story out of them.

--

### rock-paper-scissors:
File Type: Python (.py)

Ideal Platform: IDLE

A self-explanator rock, paper, scissors game where you play against the computer.

--

### masking:
File Type: Processing 3 (.pde)

Ideal Platform: Processing 3

A simple demonstration of how the masking function works with Processing 3. Your referenced images must be located within the data folder of the sketch. Find help [here](https://processing.org/examples/loaddisplayimage.html) or [here](https://processing.org/reference/).

--

### static:
File Type: Processing 3 (.pde)

Ideal Platform: Processing 3

A simple demonstration of how to make static appear on top of an image in Processing 3. Your referenced images must be located within the data folder of the sketch. Find help [here](https://processing.org/examples/loaddisplayimage.html) or [here](https://processing.org/reference/).

--

### explode:
File Type: Processing 3 (.pde)

Ideal Platform: Processing 3

An interesting proof of concept where an image is taken, and a backwards explosion on that image results. Works by taking individual pixels from the image, then drawing slightly larger circles with the same color value on that pixel's spot on the screen. After a while, the image will begin to show itself. Your referenced images must be located within the data folder of the sketch. Find help [here](https://processing.org/examples/loaddisplayimage.html) or [here](https://processing.org/reference/).

--

### fourquadrants:
File Tyoe: Processing 3 (.pde)

Ideal Platform: Processing 3

Takes an image and produces the same image, but with different color tints for each quadrant of the image. Your referenced images must be located within the data folder of the sketch. Find help [here](https://processing.org/examples/loaddisplayimage.html) or [here](https://processing.org/reference/).
