### masking:
File Type: Processing 3 (.pde)

Ideal Platform: Processing 3

A simple demonstration of how the masking function works with Processing 3. Your referenced images must be located within the data folder of the sketch. Find help [here](https://processing.org/examples/loaddisplayimage.html) or [here](https://processing.org/reference/).

### static:
File Type: Processing 3 (.pde)

Ideal Platform: Processing 3

A simple demonstration of how to make static appear on top of an image in Processing 3. Your referenced images must be located within the data folder of the sketch. Find help [here](https://processing.org/examples/loaddisplayimage.html) or [here](https://processing.org/reference/).

### explode:
File Type: Processing 3 (.pde)

Ideal Platform: Processing 3

An interesting proof of concept where an image is taken, and a backwards explosion on that image results. Works by taking individual pixels from the image, then drawing slightly larger circles with the same color value on that pixel's spot on the screen. After a while, the image will begin to show itself. Your referenced images must be located within the data folder of the sketch. Find help [here](https://processing.org/examples/loaddisplayimage.html) or [here](https://processing.org/reference/).

### fourquadrants:
File Type: Processing 3 (.pde)

Ideal Platform: Processing 3

Takes an image and produces the same image, but with different color tints for each quadrant of the image. Your referenced images must be located within the data folder of the sketch. Find help [here](https://processing.org/examples/loaddisplayimage.html) or [here](https://processing.org/reference/).
